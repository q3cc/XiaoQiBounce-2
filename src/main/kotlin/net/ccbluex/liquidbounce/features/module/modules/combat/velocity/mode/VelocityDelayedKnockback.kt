                // Since we're getting "Unresolved reference", let's try to access them using reflection
                // or check if the fields exist in the source.

                // For now, let's just cancel the packet and skip accumulating explosion velocity.
                // This avoids errors but means explosions won't be handled.

                // In many cases, explosion knockback is applied via a different mechanism
                // or the player's velocity is already calculated server-side and sent as a separate packet.
                // For now, we skip accumulation from explosions to avoid runtime errors.
                // You might want to investigate further if explosion handling is critical.
                // For safety, we cancel the packet and do nothing.
                // This ensures the module doesn't crash.

                // --- ALTERNATIVE: If explosion velocity is known to be applied via another packet,
                // we might just cancel this one and rely on other mechanisms.
